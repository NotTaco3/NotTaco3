A little about me:
Hey, I am Taco, a full-stack developer. I have been programming for 6 years now, and I have been making games for 7 years. I have been from Scratch all the way to Graphics Engines and raw code, I have been playing ches!

What I am currently working on:

My own 3d Game Engine with C++.

My own programming language.

A Java Framework that catches mistakes before you make them, preventing bugs down the line, and makes Java much easier to write it fixing your mistakes as you code!
